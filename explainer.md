## Overview

This explainer describes the "impl Trait" feature as a complete unit. However, not all parts of this story are in the same state. Some parts are available on stable, others are available on nightly, others have accepted RFCs but are not yet implemented, and still others are in the exploration phase. Each section of the explainer has a "status" tag that indicates whether the status of that particular content.

## Impl trait: make the compiler do the hard work of figuring out the exact type

**Status:** Stable

Oftentimes, you have a situation where you don't care *exactly* what type something has, you simply care that it implements particular traits. For example, you might have a function that accepts any kind of iterator as long as it produces integers. In this case, you could write the following:

```rust
fn sum_integers(integers: impl Iterator<Item = u32>) -> u32 {
    //                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    let mut sum = 0;
    for integer in integers {
        sum += x;
    }
    sum
}
```

Here, the `impl Iterator` type is a special sort of type. It doesn't actually name any particular type. Instead, it is a *shorthand* for a *generic type*. In other words, the function above is roughly equivalent to the following desugared version:

```rust
fn sum_integers<I>(integers: I) -> u32
where
    I: Integers<Item = u32>
{
    let mut sum = 0;
    for integer in integers {
        sum += x;
    }
    sum
}
```

Intuitively, a function that has an argument of type `impl Iterator` is saying "you can give me any sort of iterator that you like".
