# ðŸ“œ Impl trait Charter

## Proposal

impl-trait is an **umbrella initiative** that is generally developing the `impl Trait` syntax in Rust. The overall goal is to enable users to write `impl Trait` to mean "some type implemementing `Trait`". We wish to enable this syntax in as many places as it makes sense to do so, and to develop a coherent philosophy around its meaning.
